    <h2 id="meaning"><em>Meaning</em></h2><br>
    The word <em>Taekwondo</em> is formed by other 3 words, which are <em>Tae</em> which means kick,
    <em>Kwon</em> that means fist, and <em>Do</em>, a word we can see in many martial arts and refers to the path of the martial arts.<br>

    Taekwondo is a martial art which was developed in South Korea more than 2000 years ago and it has been practised ever since. In recent years, it has become more and more popular in western societies, and nowadays it is a widespread martial art, also considered as an olimpic sport and its number of practitioners keeps increasing.<br>
    <h2 id=belt>Ranks and belts</h2>
    Taekwondo ranks vary from style to style and are not standardized. Typically, these ranks are separated into "junior" and "senior" sections, colloquially referred to as "color belts" and "black belts":

The junior section of ranks—the "color belt" ranks—are indicated by the Korean word geup 급 (級) (also Romanized as gup or kup). Practitioners in these ranks generally wear belts ranging in color from white (the lowest rank) to red or brown (higher ranks, depending on the style of Taekwondo). Belt colors may be solid or may include a colored stripe on a solid background. The number of geup ranks varies depending on the style, typically ranging between 8 and 12 geup ranks. The numbering sequence for geup ranks usually begins at the larger number of white belts, and then counts down to "1st geup" as the highest color-belt rank.
The senior section of ranks—the "black belt" ranks—is typically made up of nine ranks. Each rank is called a dan 단 (段) or "degree" (as in "third dan" or "third-degree black belt"). The numbering sequence for dan ranks is opposite that of geup ranks: numbering begins at 1st dan (the lowest black-belt rank) and counts upward for higher ranks. A practitioner's degree is sometimes indicated on the belt itself with stripes, Roman numerals, or other methods.
